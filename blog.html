				We&apos;ve made a lot of progress in recent days.
				I was only recently hired, but in that time, we&apos;ve redesigned our website, reworked our color scheme, and we&apos;ve even created our own logo!
				Look!
				It&apos;s up there!
			</p><p>
				We have many ideas moving forward with our project.
				At the moment, we &apos; re unsure about how we want to achieve our goal, but real progress is being made towards it.
				I am very excited for the future of our project.
			</p><p>
				Currently, we&apos; re working on reaching out to potential speakers to educate about the importance of mental health and to help raise awareness.
				In addition to this, we would like to reach out across the planet to help destigmatize mental health all over the world.
				We would like to use our website and possibly other platforms to raise awareness everywhere.
				This requires more research into mental health, and that is what we are devoting much of our time to at the moment.

				We made a new hire! Last Wednesday, Pritish Tarafdar joined our team as a new designer.
				Hopefully, he&apos;ll be able to design us some things that will help our cause.
				He&apos;s currently sitting beside me creating a new color scheme for all of our ventures.
				</p><p>
				The idea of creating a mobile game of some sort that could spread awareness began going around today.
				Despite this, we&apos;ve decided to put this on hold because we think it may do more harm than good.
				I&apos;m hoping to get Peter or Ryan to start contacting some speaker who may be able to come and speak at our school.
				We&apos;re still in the process of getting to know each other as a team so not a lot of work is getting done quite yet but things will start to ramp up soon.
				It&apos;s pretty clear to all of us that we really care about this project and we all want to see it succeed.
				</p><p>
				Hopefully we&apos;ll have a little more to discuss next time, but that&apos;s just about all for now.
				We&apos;ll see you soon and until next time: keep on keeping on.

					Today we began the work on our WE service project. 
					We&apos;ve had a lot of fun learning to code but now it&apos;s time for us 
					to give back a bit more. We&apos;ve begun to work with a program called 
					WE service. Follow some instruction put up by them we will begin to 
					focus on giving back both locally and globally. In our AP CS A class 
					our topic of service is healthcare and related subjects.
					</p><p>
					Our current team is Michael Tang, Ryan Sheehan, Peter Foggo, and Zach Leahy.
					We&apos;re looking to dissolve the stigma around mental illness.
					We are hoping to bring speakers to talk both at our high school and middle school.
					In addition we&apos;d like to compile resources for people who may be either dealing with mental illness or know someone who is.

					Ryan Sheehan is currently a senior at Strath Haven High School.
					By bringing his unremarkable programming abilities and impassioned-yet-biased worldview to the table, he hopes to further the group&apos;s hegemony.
					Although the stigmatization surrounding mental health issues has improved immensely in the past few years, he believes that there is still plenty to be done.
					Just consider the fact that life expectancies rose dramatically when physical hygiene improved noticeably in the 20th century.
					With a modern day improvement to mental hygiene, why should our quality of life not do the same?

					Chief Assisstant Staffer
				</h3>
				<p id="entry">
					Peter Foggo attends Strath Haven High School and is a member of the Class of 2017.
					Mental Health and Mental Illness has grabbed his attention over the last couple of years because he has known too many people who have committed self-harm and who have struggled with depression, particularly in their youth.
					He is confident that with the appropriate level of education around this issue, we can destigmatize Mental Illness in order to create a healthy environment both in Strath Haven High School and hopefully on a national scale too!
					Mental Illness is nothing to be ashamed of; in fact, many colleges offer free therapy sessions in an effort to reach out to overly-stressed young adults who are troubled with the task of balancing various components of the collegiate life.

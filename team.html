					Peter Foggo attends Strath Haven High School and is a member of the Class of 2017. Mental Health and Mental Illness has grabbed his attention over the last couple of years because he has known too many people who have committed self-harm and who have struggled with depression, particularly in their youth. He is confident that with the appropriate level of education around this issue, we can destigmatize Mental Illness in order to create a healthy environment both in Strath Haven High School and hopefully on a national scale too! Mental Illness is nothing to be ashamed of; in fact, many colleges offer free therapy sessions in an effort to reach out to overly-stressed young adults who are troubled with the task of balancing various components of the collegiate life.
